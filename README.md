# TactileTTC

This repo is primarly to test code for the tactors that we purchased from Engineering Acoustics, Inc. The tactors will be used for our experiments (e.g., tactile TTC, haptic alerts for automated driving, etc).

Master branch contains the intial experiment we conducted for tactile TTC.

TactorInterface branch contains Adam's example code that demonstrates the ramp function based on Auditory Tau.
